# MiningCooldownFix
REQUIRES MINECRAFT 1.20.x & FABRIC 0.14.24 OR NEWER

By default, the Minecraft client has a hard-coded delay of 300 ms (6 ticks) between breaking blocks, unless your tools, enchantments, and potion effects are strong enough to completely bypass it, as per the following wiki article: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breaking#Instant_breaking  
   
This mod simply sets that delay to 0, allowing you to break multiple blocks much faster than before, without affecting the time it takes to break a single block.
